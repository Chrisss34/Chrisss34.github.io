### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 part 1 was a favorite because I liked how simple it was to change Fahrenheit to Celsius. This was the first time I was able to make the code for the first time by myself and for it to change Fahrenheit to Celsius. 
 
    Lab 2 part 3 was a favorite because on how easy it was. It was easy enough just to print hello world. There was not much to it. It was a good way to learn how to cout and cin.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I never knew how to play the game Blackjack. I was able to write functions to give the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many Aces were dealt.
